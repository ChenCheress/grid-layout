# grid-layout
show some CSS examples with grid layout.

Here is the examples to use grid layout. It's very smart and responsive. Usually it has a container and some conponents inside the container. 

Note: It has not been supportted by all explorers. even IE10 and Edge are not support it yet. I have runed the examples on Chrome57.0.2987.98 and not sure if other version support it.
